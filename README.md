# Dasmotos Arts Crafts V2

I wanted to challenge myself and create a Version 2 of the Codecademy Dasmoto project.

Instead of just building the website as shown as the template like in the course, I want to do something that will make the website more modern.

It won't include things like buttons but I wanted to challenge myself on the design, changing the box model, etc. to make it as modern as I can as if they are a client from a art shop wanting to modernize their website.
